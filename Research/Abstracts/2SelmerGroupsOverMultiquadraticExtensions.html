    Let \(K/\mathbb{Q}\) be a multiquadratic extension.  We investigate the average dimension of \(2\)-Selmer groups over \(K\) for the family of all elliptic curves over \(\mathbb{Q}\) (ordered by height).  We give upper and lower bounds for this average.  In the special case of quadratic fields, these bounds are arbitrarily close for a positive proportion of \(K/\mathbb{Q}\).  Our bounds are achieved by studying the genus theory invariant for \(2\)-Selmer groups over such fields, whose average we similarly bound and, in many cases, determine.  We make use of a variant of the Ekedahl sieve for local sums, which we present in appropriate generality for further applications.
