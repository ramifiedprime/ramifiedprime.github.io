    We study the behaviour of conductors of \(L\)-functions associated to certain Weil--Deligne representations under twisting.  For each global field \(K\) we prove a sharp upper bound for the conductor of the Rankin--Selberg \(L\)-function \(L(A\boxtimes B,s)\) where \(A,B/K\) are abelian varieties.
