    Let \(D\neq 1\) be a fixed squarefree integer.  For elliptic curves \(E/\mathbb{Q}\), writing \(E_D\) for the quadratic twist by \(D\), we consider the question of how often \(E(\mathbb{Q})\) and \(E_{D}(\mathbb{Q})\) generate \(E(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{D}))\).  We bound the proportion of \(E\), ordered by height, for which this is not the case, showing that it is very small for typical \(D\).

    The central theorem is concerned with intersections of \(2\)-Selmer groups of quadratic twists.  We establish their average size in terms of a product of local densities.  We additionally propose a heuristic model for these intersections, which explains our result and similar results in the literature.  This heuristic predicts further results in other families.
