    Let $E/\mathbb{Q}$ be an elliptic curve with full rational $2$-torsion. As $d$ varies over squarefree integers, we study the behaviour of the quadratic twists $E_d$ over a fixed quadratic extension $K/\mathbb{Q}$. We prove that for $100\%$ of twists the dimension of the $2$-Selmer group over $K$ is given by an explicit local formula, and use this to show that this dimension follows an Erdős--Kac type distribution. This is in stark contrast to the distribution of the dimension of the corresponding $2$-Selmer groups over $\mathbb{Q}$, and this discrepancy allows us to determine the distribution of the $2$-torsion in the Shafarevich--Tate groups of the $E_d$ over $K$ also.
    
    As a consequence of our methods we prove that, for $100\%$ of twists $d$, the action of $\text{Gal}(K/\mathbb{Q})$ on the $2$-Selmer group of $E_d$ over $K$ is trivial, and the Mordell--Weil group $E_d(K)$ splits integrally as a direct sum of its invariants and anti-invariants. On the other hand, we give examples of thin families of quadratic twists in which a positive proportion of the $2$-Selmer groups over $K$ have non-trivial $\text{Gal}(K/\mathbb{Q})$-action, illustrating that the previous results are genuinely statistical phenomena.
