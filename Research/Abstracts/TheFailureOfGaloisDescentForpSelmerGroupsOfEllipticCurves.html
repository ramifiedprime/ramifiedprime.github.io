    We show that if \(F\) is \(\mathbb{Q}\)$ or a multiquadratic number field, \(p\in\{2,3,5\}\)$, and \(K/F\) is a Galois extension of degree a power of \(p\), then for elliptic curves \(E/\mathbb{Q}\) ordered by height, the average dimension of the \(p\)-Selmer groups of \(E/K\) is bounded.  In particular, this provides a bound for the average \(K\)-rank of elliptic curves \(E/\mathbb{Q}\) for such \(K\).  Additionally, we give bounds for certain representation--theoretic invariants of Mordell--Weil groups over Galois extensions of such \(F\).

    The central result is that: for each finite Galois extension \(K/F\) of number fields and prime number \(p\), as \(E/\mathbb{Q}\) varies, the difference in dimension between the Galois fixed space in the \(p\)-Selmer group of \(E/K\) and the \(p\)-Selmer group of \(E/F\) has bounded average.
