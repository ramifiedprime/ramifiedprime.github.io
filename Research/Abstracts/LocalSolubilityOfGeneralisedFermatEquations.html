    For every \(n \geq 2\) we determine the asymptotic formula for the number of integer triples \((a,b,c)\) of bounded absolute value such that the generalised Fermat equation given by \(ax^n+by^n+cz^n=0\) is everywhere locally soluble.  We compute the leading constant, answering a question of Loughran--Rome--Sofos, and determine that the conjectures of Loughran--Smeets and Loughran--Rome--Sofos hold for such equations.
